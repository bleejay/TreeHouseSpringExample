# TreeHouseSpringExample
My version of the code walk-through on tree house under the track 'spring basics'

##GifLib

###Features
The app itself is a library of animated GIFs, along the lines of giphy. It has the following pages:

* Home page, listing all GIFs in the library
* Favourites page, listing all the GIFs that have been listed as a favourite (this is not a user interaction - instead is predetermined in the assignment of each GIF)
* Detail page for each GIF, showing the user that uploaded it and the date it was uploaded (again, predetermined)
* Categories page, this contains three categories with links to all the GIFs that fall under these respectively (these were predetermined by myself and each GIF can only be assigned to one category)

As well as these pages the app also has a search functionality - 
* can search from any page containing the search bar
* searches GIF's name for keyword
* searches GIf's uploader for keyword

###Future Development Steps

* Allow assignment of multiple categories to GIFs
* look at user authentication and interaction tracks on treehouse and implement some of these ideas
    * eg/ set up account and mark certain items as favourites
* look at implementing a database to utilize dynamic data
* add more GIFSs and categories
